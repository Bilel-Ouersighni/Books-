#Reverse Engineering

1. OllyDbg - (Author: Oleh Yuschuk)
  - ollydbg is 32 bit assembler level analyzing debugger for Microsoft Windows  applications.
  - Emphsis on binary code analysis for applications that arent open source and source is unavailable
  - cough, cough, cracking commercial software 
    - It traces the following:
        * Traces  regsters 
        * Recognizes procedures
        * API calls
        * Switches 
        * Tables  
        * constants and strings 
        * As well as locates routines from objects files and libraries?

PRO: User friendly interface 

  - version 1.10 is the final version 
  - The software is free of cost, but the shareware requires users to register with the author (WOW, TO AVOID SKETCHY ACTS BEING HANDLED WITH HIS SOFTWARE)
  
CON: OllyDbg cant disassemble binaries compiled for 64-bit processers. Though don't be alarmed, a 64-bit version of the debugger is supposedly in the works.    

BACKTRACK:
  - OllyDbg is often used for reverse engineering programs
      - used by cracker to crack software made by other developers 
          Crackers: are individuals who "love" to crack DRM and software licensing schemes
                        * SolidSQUAD(SSQ) being one group of "crackers"
